# NIDS-Final-Project
The Network Intrusion Detection System using Deep Learning (DeepNIDS) detects malicious network activities by learning patterns from traffic data. It uses deep learning models like DNN, CNN, and LSTM to identify known and unknown attacks in real time with high accuracy and reduced false positives.
